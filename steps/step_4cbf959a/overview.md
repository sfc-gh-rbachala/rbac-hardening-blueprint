In this step, you'll generate diagnostic queries that reveal the complete role hierarchy in your Snowflake account. These queries help you visualize how roles are connected, discover orphaned roles with no parent, and identify hierarchies that are excessively deep.

**Account Context:** Execute these queries from the target account with ACCOUNTADMIN role (for Account Usage access).

## Why is this important?

A healthy role hierarchy is the foundation of Snowflake RBAC. Common issues include:
- **Orphaned roles** — Roles granted to no parent, making them unreachable from system roles
- **Excessive depth** — Hierarchies deeper than 5 levels are hard to audit and maintain
- **Missing connections** — Data product roles not wired up to SYSADMIN
- **Circular grants** — Roles that form loops (rare but possible)

Without visibility into the full hierarchy, you cannot confirm that your RBAC design is implemented correctly.

## Prerequisites

- Account accessible with ACCOUNTADMIN or SECURITYADMIN role
- SNOWFLAKE database IMPORTED PRIVILEGES granted (for Account Usage views)
- Data Product Setup completed (if auditing data product roles)

## Key Concepts

**Role Hierarchy**
Snowflake roles form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each role can be granted to one or more parent roles, and a role inherits all privileges of its child roles.

**System Roles**
| Role | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| ACCOUNTADMIN | Top-level role — should be break-glass only |
| SECURITYADMIN | Manages grants and role assignments |
| SYSADMIN | Creates and owns databases, schemas, warehouses |
| USERADMIN | Creates and manages users and roles |
| PUBLIC | Automatically granted to every user |

**Orphaned Roles**
A role that is not granted to any parent role (except PUBLIC) is effectively unreachable from the standard hierarchy. This usually indicates incomplete setup or a role that was created manually outside of the blueprint process.

## Best Practices

- Every custom role should eventually roll up to SYSADMIN (for object access) or SECURITYADMIN (for security management)
- Keep hierarchy depth to 5 levels or fewer for auditability
- Use the Data Product Setup pattern: READ → WRITE → CREATE → ADMIN → SYSADMIN
- Review orphaned roles quarterly and either wire them into the hierarchy or drop them

## How to Test

1. Run the role hierarchy query and verify all data product roles connect to SYSADMIN
2. Check the orphaned roles query — any results need investigation
3. Confirm hierarchy depth is within acceptable limits

### Configuration Questions

#### What scope should the RBAC audit cover? (`rbac_audit_scope`: multi-select)
Choose whether to audit the full account or limit to specific data product role hierarchies. A full account audit is recommended for first-time hardening.

**Options:**
- Full Account
- Specific Data Products

#### Which data product prefixes should the RBAC audit cover? (`rbac_target_prefixes`: list)
If scoping to specific data products, provide the role name prefixes. Run `SHOW ROLES LIKE '%_ADMIN';` to find them.
