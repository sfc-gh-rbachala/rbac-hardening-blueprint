In this step, you'll enforce separation of duties for Snowflake system roles by restricting ACCOUNTADMIN to designated break-glass users only. All other users will have ACCOUNTADMIN revoked and should use SECURITYADMIN, SYSADMIN, or USERADMIN for their day-to-day work.

**Account Context:** Execute from the target account with SECURITYADMIN role.

## Why is this important?

ACCOUNTADMIN is the most powerful role in Snowflake. It can bypass all access controls, manage billing, and perform any operation. When too many users hold ACCOUNTADMIN:
- **Audit trails become meaningless** — you can't distinguish emergency access from routine use
- **Blast radius increases** — a compromised account with ACCOUNTADMIN can access everything
- **Compliance fails** — SOC 2, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS all require separation of duties

## Prerequisites

- Task 1 (RBAC Assessment) completed — Step 1.2 shows current ACCOUNTADMIN holders
- Break-glass user list approved by security team
- All ACCOUNTADMIN users should have MFA enabled

## Key Concepts

**System Role Responsibilities**
| Role | Purpose | Day-to-Day Use |
|------|---------|---------------|
| ACCOUNTADMIN | Account-level administration, billing | **Break-glass only** |
| SECURITYADMIN | Grant management, role hierarchy | Security operations |
| SYSADMIN | Database, schema, warehouse management | Platform operations |
| USERADMIN | User and role creation | Identity management |

**Break-Glass Pattern**
Break-glass users are emergency-access accounts used only when no other role can perform a required operation. They should:
- Be dedicated accounts (not shared with daily-use accounts)
- Have MFA enabled
- Be monitored for usage (any login should trigger an alert)
- Be documented in your incident response procedures

## Best Practices

- Limit ACCOUNTADMIN to 2-3 break-glass users
- Never use ACCOUNTADMIN for daily operations
- Ensure break-glass users have MFA enabled
- Monitor ACCOUNTADMIN usage with alerts (see Task 4)
- Document when and why ACCOUNTADMIN is used in your runbook

## How to Test

1. Verify authorized users can activate ACCOUNTADMIN when needed
2. Verify unauthorized users cannot activate ACCOUNTADMIN
3. Confirm daily operations work without ACCOUNTADMIN using appropriate system roles
